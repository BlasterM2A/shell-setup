# shell-setup

A CLI/TUI that bootstraps and maintains a zsh environment on Ubuntu/Debian.
It installs and keeps up to date:

- **Built-in** (always installed; shell-setup needs them): zsh (as the login
  shell) and [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)
- [starship](https://starship.rs/), [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
  and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), installed through mise
- [antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) with zsh-autosuggestions and
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
- JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
- AI CLIs (optional, a failure is only a warning): Claude Code, GitHub Copilot
  CLI, Junie, Antigravity CLI (`agy`)

## Install on a new machine

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlasterM2A/shell-setup/master/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest release binary to `~/.local/bin/shell-setup`
(checksum verified) and runs `shell-setup init`. Expect a **sudo** prompt
(apt packages) and possibly a **chsh** password prompt (login shell).

After the first `init`:

1. Log out and back in (the new login shell needs a new session).
2. Select **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font** in your terminal's font settings.

## Migrating from the old install.sh

Run the one-liner above once. Then:

- Your old `~/.zshrc` is backed up to `~/.zshrc.bak.<timestamp>` and replaced
  by a one-line stub. Move your personal lines into `~/.config/zsh/*.d`
  (see [Where things live](#where-things-live)).
- starship, zoxide and fzf are reinstalled via mise. The old copies
  (`~/.local/bin/starship`, `~/.local/bin/zoxide`, apt's `fzf`) can be
  removed; `shell-setup doctor` lists the leftovers it finds.
- The Nerd Font now lives in `~/.local/share/fonts/JetBrainsMonoNerdFont`;
  the old `JetBrainsMono*.ttf` files directly in `~/.local/share/fonts` can
  be deleted.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `shell-setup init` | Install what is missing, write the shell config, make zsh the login shell |
| `shell-setup update` | Same as init, plus update every installed tool. `--force` overwrites managed files you edited (a backup is kept) |
| `shell-setup doctor` | Check tools, managed files and the login shell; exits non-zero if something required is missing |
| `shell-setup self-update` | Replace the binary with the latest release; then run `shell-setup update` |

Global flags: `--plain` (no interactive UI), `--verbose`, `--quiet`.

## Where things live

| Path | Owner |
|---|---|
| `~/.config/zsh/{env,functions,aliases,custom}.d/*.zsh` | **You.** Auto-loaded, never touched by shell-setup |
| `~/.zshrc` | shell-setup (a one-line stub) |
| `~/.config/shell-setup/zshrc`, `zsh.d/`, `plugins.txt` | shell-setup (generated) |
| `~/.config/starship.toml` | shell-setup |
| `~/.config/shell-setup/config.toml` | You (optional: `log_level`) |
| `~/.local/state/shell-setup/` | shell-setup (state, log) |

If you edit a file shell-setup manages, `update` leaves it alone and `doctor`
reports it as modified; `update --force` replaces it after a backup
(`<file>.bak.<timestamp>`). Put personal config in `~/.config/zsh/*.d` instead.

## Development

```bash
mise install          # Go, Task, goreleaser, golangci-lint
task test             # Go tests + bootstrap script tests
task lint             # golangci-lint, including dependency rules (depguard)
task run -- doctor    # run the CLI from source
task snapshot         # local release build into ./dist
```

Add a tool by adding `internal/shellsetup/registry/<id>.toml` (and any config
file under `registry/files/`). No Go code is needed if its backend exists.

Release: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags` (GitHub Actions runs goreleaser).
